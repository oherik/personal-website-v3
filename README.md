# Erik's personal website, v3

This is the third iteration of my personal website, [erikohrn.com](https://erikohrn.com/). The previous versions lacked a clear purpose and I haven't spent too much time maintaining the last one, so it was time for a change.

## Goal

Create a simple and stylish landing page for my personal website, and make it really fast. It should be easy to understand code-wise, and come with as few dependencies as possible. It's a "back to the roots" website, more or less.

## What this is

This is a very simple landing site so my domain erikohrn.com has something to greet any potential visitors. It's purpose is to have links to various portfolios, both code and photography, as well as my resume.

## What this is not

This page is not a full portfolio page, and neither is its code. The code is written with a very specific purpose in mind (see above), and therefore does not show my full knowledge of React, Vue, AWS, CSS preprocessors, backend work, etc. It's simple by design.
